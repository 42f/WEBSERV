Alena : check cgi in config file directly
        - operator= for every socket componenet

Brian :
        ✅ fix location resolver pour /
        ✅ check autoindex with non existing pouette.html -> ok 404 returned
        🔴 operator= for every socket componenet
        ✅ check redirect variables

        🚧 autoindex: test
        🚧 POST

        - GET with query
        - Version: rfc (client ><= server).
        - redirect:
                - double quotes in string argument of config file, should they stay ?
                - we should allow empty argument : `return 404;`
                        Syntax:	return code [text];
                                return code URL;
                                return URL;

Calixte :
        - autoindex, finish system error cgi, rethink execve fail, check nginx response when cgi code fails
        - Your program should call the cgi with the file requested as first argument = ask Prawda

        - add post body and query parameters to cgi = WIP (need to find an efficient way to put request data on stdin for execve);

        - check cgi execution directory ? ok merci Brian

        - autoindex = WIP


Network: close fd on send response when not successful ?

Delete : src/server.hpp/.cpp ?

Check copy sockets

all :
        - You should never do a read operation or a write operation without going through
                poll (or equivalent).
        - Leaks
        - request timeout system (to do)
        - HARD TEST DELETE && GET && EVERYTHING
        - Python-CGI
        - test webserv with tester

why not ? :
        - implement non chunked cgi reponse for fast cgi/small responses (= content_length in the subject)
