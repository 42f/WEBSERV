        - Your program should call the cgi with the file requested as first argument = ask Prawda
        
        - cgi = add post body 

        - autoindex = filter files

        - free all allocations


Network: close fd on send response when not successful ?

Delete : src/server.hpp/.cpp ?

Check copy sockets

all :
        - You should never do a read operation or a write operation without going through
                poll (or equivalent).
        - Leaks
        - request timeout system (to do)
        - HARD TEST DELETE && GET && EVERYTHING
        - Python-CGI
        - test webserv with tester
