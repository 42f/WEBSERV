CGI :   error checking for everything
        check cgi header to see what's needed
        error 501 when system fail ? (fork, pipe, etc...)
        rethink the done/readable part, done = executed =/= nothing to read

Network: close fd on send response when not successful ?


Questions :
        POST a un body ? si oui le buffer de rcv request ne vas pas marcher
        unchunk request ?



Changes on mate's code :
        - changed sendheader : added a boolean for \r\n in case it's not cgi. Also commented this part on the operator << in response.cpp
