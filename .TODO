        - operator= for every socket componenet

Brian :
        âœ… fix location resolver pour /
        âœ… check autoindex with non existing pouette.html -> ok 404 returned
        ðŸŸ¥ operator= for every socket componenet
        âœ… check redirect variables

        ðŸš§ POST

        - Version: rfc.


Calixte : autoindex, finish system error cgi, rethink execve fail, check nginx response when cgi code fails
        - Your program should call the cgi with the file requested as first argument = ask Prawda
        - switch to list instead of vector for sockets.
        
        - add post body and query parameters to cgi = WIP (need to find an efficient way to put request data on stdin for execve);

        - check cgi execution directory ?

        - autoindex
        - operator= for every socket component
        - CGI not handle, see with Brian


Network: close fd on send response when not successful ?

Delete : src/server.hpp/.cpp ?

Check copy sockets

all :
        - You should never do a read operation or a write operation without going through
                poll (or equivalent).
        - Leaks
        - request timeout system (to do)
        - HARD TEST DELETE && GET && EVERYTHING
        - Python-CGI
        - test webserv with tester

why not ? :
        - implement non chunked cgi reponse for fast cgi/small responses (= content_length in the subject)
