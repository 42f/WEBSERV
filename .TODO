Calixte : autoindex, finish system error cgi, rethink execve fail, check nginx response when cgi code fails
        - Your program should call the cgi with the file requested as first argument = ask Prawda
        - check cgi execution directory
        - operator= for every socket component
        - swith to list instead of vector for sockets.


Network: close fd on send response when not successful ?

Delete : src/server.hpp/.cpp ?

Check copy sockets

all :
        - You should never do a read operation or a write operation without going through
                poll (or equivalent).
        - Leaks
        - request timeout system (to do)
        - HARD TEST DELETE && GET && EVERYTHING
        - Python-CGI
        - test webserv with tester

why not ? :
        - implement non chunked cgi reponse for fast cgi/small responses (= content_length in the subject)
